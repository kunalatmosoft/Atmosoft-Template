  Atmosoft !!!<br/>
  Have you ever listen about what is the basic theme of this Atmosoft
  So here let&apos;s discuss about what is basically the term atmosoft that precedes in the quiet confusion among the audience let&apos;s Start describing the main agenda of the atmosoft 
  So the atmosoft is come from the two words and the two words basically are Atom and soft so discuss about our first word that is Atom this signifies that discovery of atom in every field that is to  know everything in the depth and to find out the necessity and also the solidity of content in the realistic matters and also second word that is soft this shows that the possibility of the impossible task using the software so simply it dignifies that how to made easily and possible anything using the software 
  # How it&apos;s possible by Atmosoft?
  So in order to find the actual pathway of finding our destiny we make a platform using Ai artificial intelligence that is a kind of Operating system by improving the unix and linux versions and make it private so that it can be accessible in paid versions it unite the build in functions that access the simplicity and defeat the other operating systems like Microsoft and ios and other versions.
  We make the os in more dynamic island that looks very amazing and also it is fully based on the simple language it can be very efficient and not need any more coding language that simply makes the availability in the market and also this access in the market doesn&apos;t leaks the effectiveness of the our os
  #  Expansion of the Atmosoft!!!
  Though as we make our os and also we emerge many users as possible thus we make our smartphones also pc&apos;s and desktops in order to promote the semiconductors industry thus we get a plus point in making the fixation of our civilization among the world .thus getting now overall ideas we are now at a stand that firstly we make a ai generative os and then we move forward by taking the access of the hardware and then now more idea to expand the Atmosoft is we take the overall control in creative like main agenda for the creative ideas is to defeat the Adobe full company, we provide a build in  software of creative platforms and also our next task is to providing the consulting ideas to defeat many market consulting areas because in this time we get many trust from the users s everyone get attractive towards our ideas and  also we encourage the networking platform to joint their hands in to the atmosoft so that only one platform provides the overall availability and this encourage everyone to use atmosoft‚Ä¶
  
  # How to earn from Atmosoft 
  As I told the overall theme of our business so now we come forward by taking the main ideas to how to earn from these ideas .We give our software that is our os in affordable prizes and also we make an agreement in the name of the user so that he/she can deposit their plans in every month so that everyone can access the overall usage of the every platform.so that by viewing the point of view of the Atmosoft can spread ot&apos;s personality among the market.
  # Problems in establishment of the Atmosoft.
  As by viewing the ideas of the it&apos;s take a huge time and one of the major problem is that it takes a lot of money that is not possible by an individual like me to executive these ideas among the people. And also many other paltforms makes a great trust among their users so its implementation takes a lots of time.
  LACK OF [TTM] Time, Trust, Money.
